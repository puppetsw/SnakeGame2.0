# Snake Game 2.0
An attempt at making a multiplayer snake game using python. 
The idea came from a fellow student at MIT who had a similar idea.

## Current Status
The very base game is working to some degree. I am currently working
on adding game states and menus to the game. I will then hook it all up
into a single player game. 

I have decided to add an AI to the game. That way I can test the second player
before adding multiplayer.

From there I will work on the socket 
client/server implementation.

mechanics please feel free to add them.
